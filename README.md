🧠 DSA Pattern Learning Platform
📚 Learn Core Problem-Solving Patterns in Data Structures and Algorithms

The DSA Pattern Learning Platform is a web-based learning tool designed to help students and developers understand the most important Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem-solving patterns.
It provides concise explanations, Java code templates, and curated LeetCode problem lists — all in a clean and responsive interface.

🚀 Features

🔍 Interactive DSA Pattern Cards – Explore patterns like Prefix Sum, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Fast & Slow Pointers, Heaps, Monotonic Queue, and Greedy Algorithms.

💻 Base Code Templates – Each pattern includes ready-to-use code snippets and problem templates.

🧩 Concept Breakdown – Each pattern highlights when to use, why it works, and common pitfalls.

📱 Responsive UI – Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a smooth learning experience on all devices.

💡 LeetCode Integration – Each section links to related LeetCode problems for hands-on practice.
